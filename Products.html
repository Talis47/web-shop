      Ada's article sadly received little attention from readers when she was alive mainly due to her being a bright, somewhat revolutionary scientist in a male dominated field. Though, her contributions to the computer science field were only discovered in the 1950’s.  When B.V. Bowden reintroduced her notes and thoughts to the modern computing world. He republished them in Faster Than Thought: A Symposium on Digital Computing Machines in 1953. From that point Ada received numerous posthumous honors for her work, and in 1980, the U.S. Department of Defense named one of their newly developed computer languages "Ada," after Ada Lovelace.

      One can also suggest that another part of her legacy would be her battle as a female in a suppressive, male dominated field. Through her continuous battle against pompous male academics that regarded her as inferior due to her gender Ada still continued her academic endeavours. Ada serves as a role model to both female mathematicians and also women in general who find themselves confronted by male supremacy. She highlights how forward-facing thinking is key for discovering new concepts and ideas.
