        <h1 class="background">Who is Ada Lovelace?</h1>
        <p>
          Augusta Ada Byron, better known as Ada Lovelace was the only legitimate child of the renowned British poet Lord George Gordon Byron. Lord Byron's marriage to Ada's mother, Lady Anne Isabella Milbanke Byron did not last long. The marriage was not a happy one, and Lady Byron separated from him only 8 weeks after Ada’s birth. After this separation Lord Byron left England, which was in fact the last time Ada saw her father as Byron later died in Greece when Ada was 8 years old.

        </p>
        <p>
          Ada’s upbringing was therefore rather unorthodox, living in aristocratic Britain in the mid 1800’s without a father figure or male led household. Lady Byron acknowledged Ada’s academic promise, insisting that she persued both mathematics and science with numerous academic tutors. This was unheard of during this period, the sciences and mathematics were regarded as male subjects, that exceeded the academic understanding of women at the time. However, Ada’s mother disregarded this common belief as she believed that engaging in such studies would serve as character building for her daughter.

          <p>
            Ada showed a clear talent for numbers and language. Thus, receiving tuition from William Frend(social reformer) William King(the family's doctor) and Mary Somerville(Scottish mathematician and astronomer). Of these three Mary Somerville was arguably the most important, as she was one of the first women to be admitted into the Royal Astronomical Society. Giving Ada the ambition to achieve her goals as a female mathematician in a male dominated field.
          </p>

          <p>
            During her late teens Ada met the mathematician and inventor Charles Babbage. The pair took up correspondence and the much older Babbage served as a tutor to Ada. Through Babbage, Ada started studying advanced mathematics with the University of London professor Augustus de Morgan. Giving her the foundation of knowledge to make her own theories and ideas regarding computing and Babbages's Analytical engine.

        <h3>Later life:</h3>
        <p>
          In 1835, Ada married William King, who received the title of Earl of Lovelace three years later. Thus, Ada was known as Countess of Lovelace. They both had a passion for academic pursuits and also horses, William supported Ada’s academic endeavours which was deemed unusual at the time. The married couple had three children together, and lived happily together. However, two years later after a bout of cholera in 1837 Ada began to spiral downwards. After receiving painkillers such as opium from the doctor her personality began to change, experiencing severe hallucinations and mood changes.
        </p>
        <p>
          In her later years, Ada attempted to develop mathematical concepts for winning at gambling. Unfortunately, her concepts failed and led her to financial instability. Ada later died from uterine cancer in London on November 27, 1852, and she was buried next to her father, in the graveyard of the Church of St. Mary Magdalene in Nottingham, England.
