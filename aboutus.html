    <h1 class="background">Ada's Contributions:</h1>

  <p> Ada was always fascinated by machines. Spending hours studying drawings and diagrams of new inventions, reading any periodical journals she could get her hands on. She began to think about how she would design a steam-powered flying machine, studying the anatomy of birds to help her understand the mechanics of flight. She understood that the wings would need to be in proportion to the size of the body, where the steam engine would be located to provide power. Her design preceded the aerial steam carriage, patented by William Henson and John Stringfellow in 1842, by 15 years. Ada was merely 12 years old. This achievement highlights Ada's talent. However, the misogynistic society in which she was brought up meant that she was not always given the opportunities that a male counterpart would have received.

    Ada was later requested to translate an article on Babbage's analytical engine that had been written by Italian engineer Luigi Federico Menabrea for a Swiss journal. She not only translated the original French text into English, but also added her own ideas and views on the machine. Her notes ended up being three times longer than the original article. Her work was later published in 1843, in an English science journal. Ada used only the initials "A.A.L.," for Augusta Ada Lovelace, in the publication. This was possibly due to the anonymity of female academics at the time. Many other writers and scientists had to hide their true identities in hope of a larger reception of readers.

    <p>In her notes, Ada described how codes could be created for the device to handle letters and symbols along with numbers. She also theorised a method for the engine to repeat a series of instructions, a process known as looping that computer programs use today. Ada also offered modern, forward-thinking concepts in the article. For her work, Ada is often considered to be the first computer programmer.

    <h3> Post Youth</h3>
    <p>
      Ada's article sadly received little attention from readers when she was alive mainly due to her being a bright, somewhat revolutionary scientist in a male dominated field. Though, her contributions to the computer science field were only discovered in the 1950’s.  When B.V. Bowden reintroduced her notes and thoughts to the modern computing world. He republished them in Faster Than Thought: A Symposium on Digital Computing Machines in 1953. From that point Ada received numerous posthumous honors for her work, and in 1980, the U.S. Department of Defense named one of their newly developed computer languages "Ada," after Ada Lovelace.
